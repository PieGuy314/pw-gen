# pw-gen
Password Generator

Generate a fairly strong password in the format xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

Use 'pwgen' if available. Otherwise use output from /dev/urandom.

Note: The character set used for the /dev/urandom method is less strict than that of 'pwgen' with the ambiguous
command line option.

If that similarity is required, use 'a-km-zACEFHJ-NPRT-Y3479'
